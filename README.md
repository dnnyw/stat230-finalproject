 Reanalyzed the paper using leverage score analysis and considering a logit model and calculating the average marginal effect on the probability of conviction instead of the author's assumption of a linear probabilty model. 

 Converted the authors code from STATA to R in order to make use of Fixed Effects Linear Modelling packages to decrease computation time.
